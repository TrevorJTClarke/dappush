State Channels:
Example use cases:
- remittance/customer support
- micro-payments, payment channels
- IoT - slock.it
- Shared savings account

Notes:
- CREATE2 - counterfactual instantiation, allows lots of up front work to take place, and closing the channel upon disagreements and final state change

State Channel Bootnodes
An economy driven application architecture

Architecture:
- redis
- WebRTC - https://peerjs.com/
- nodejs

Research

RPS:
- both players deploy contracts
- on confirmation of both contracts, channel is open
- players use this formula for moving state forward:
   - 1. Resting - current state, no changes
   - 2. Propose - Provide some stake value, and a hashed state update
   - 3. Accept - Other person provides their state update & accepts the stake allotment
   - 4. Reveal - Original person responds with hash salt, state raw value, and updates state allotment based on stake value
   - 5. Resting - Other person accepts the change by sending current state

Payment Channels:
- Prefund setup
- Funding
- Postfund setup
- Game/interactions
   - Library that uses pure functions only to validate proposed state change validity
- Conclusion
